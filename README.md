# Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer - PHYS358 final project  

[Overleaf document for the report](https://www.overleaf.com/7025264gkhpvqkzbmhc)  

All the pdfs and code for the project should be in here, and we'll edit it as we go along

Progress:
  - Pseudocode for the radiative transfer written
  - Basic plotting written and working with random data
  - Some helper functions defined
